# CONFIGRC
Here are my config files in case my Linux goes down. You should be able to find the following configuration files :
- Emacs
- Nano
- Zsh

# Features in .emacs
- Linum mode
- tab width = 4
- theme misterioso
- starting message disabled
- color syntax
- color parenthesis pair
- mouse wheel enabled
- temp files disabled (#*# and ~*)
- menu bar disabled

# Features un .nanorc
- Tab width = 4

# Features in .zshrc
- added oh-my-zsh
- theme agnoster
- lots of aliases
- a random Start Wars and Doom quotes generator
- plugins : git and zsh-autosuggestions
- auto update (every 30 days)
- custom prompt and rprompt (with non-ASCII characters, works well on Terminator)

That's it. Feel free to get them, but try not to modify the repo please, cause it is for private usage.
Thanks
